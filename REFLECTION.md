1. What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
   This is my first time using this program, and I learned that Git is the installed software, and GitHub is the website where you can see your projects. I practiced creating a repository, cloned it to my computer, added files, staged changes, committed my work, and pushed the update to GitHub.
   
2. What was most confusing or frustrating?
   A challenge I faced was navigating the folders in Git Bash. When creating my repository, I somehow added a dash in front of the name, which caused issues following commands. Thankfully, I was able to correct it, and things were easier. 
   
3. Why do you think developers use Git?
   Developers use Git because it keeps a history of changes, making collaborative work easier since multiple people can work on the same project. You can also catch any mistakes if a bug appears by checking past commits and seeing where the problem started. Additionally, it seems like most companies use Git as an industry standard.
   
4. How might this help with larger projects in the future?
   You are able to easily collaborate with your teammates without overwriting anybody's work. The project stays structured, so nothing gets lost. You can find bugs in the code more easily and track your progress.
